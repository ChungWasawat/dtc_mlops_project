# Coupon Accepting Model
## Project Description
This project is a MLOps project for MLOps Zoomcamp course by DataTalks.Club. The goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of building an MLOps pipeline. The main model used for predicting whether a person will accept recommended coupons while they are in their vehicles is XGBoost. The dataset utilized for this project is the "In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains various features related to users, merchants, and the coupons to be recommended.
